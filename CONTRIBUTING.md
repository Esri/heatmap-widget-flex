This guide describes how you can contribute improvements to the ArcGIS Viewer for Flex source code.

The [ArcGIS Viewer for Flex HeatMap Widget](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=43daf0ffb1d34e31ad752da1340aeb40) is a sample widget that was originally built by the Lloyd Heberlie at [Esri](http://www.esri.com) and has had many contributions from the Flex Team at [Esri](http://www.esri.com). We are excited that you are interested in improving the HeatMap Widget source code. This guide will help make sure your contribution (pull request) will be accepted and easily merged.

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [HeatMap Widget repo](../../) on GitHub.
3. Clone it to your local machine.
4. Checkout the [develop branch](../../tree/develop).
5. Create a new feature branch on your local machine.
	* The name of the branch doesn't matter, but as a best practice use a descriptive name like "add-min-max-scale-to-layer".
6. Write code to add an enhancement or fix the problem.  
	* Follow the coding conventions already used in the HeatMap Widget source code (spaces instead of tabs, proper indentation, use [Flex Formatter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexformatter/files/) along with our [Flex Formatter settings](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-viewer-flex/blob/develop/FlexFormatter.properties)).
	* Document your code.
	* Make commits of logical units.
	* Use [clear and descriptive commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
